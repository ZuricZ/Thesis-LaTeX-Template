My deepest gratitude goes to my supervisor, Antoine Jacquier, whose guidance and genuine care for my progress have been invaluable throughout my PhD journey.

I would like to express my appreciation to my collaborators, Łukasz Szpruch, David Šiška, and Marc Sabaté-Vidales for their valuable contributions and fruitful discussions. Their expertise and collaboration have significantly enriched my research. In addition, I would like to thank Łukasz and the Alan Turing Institute for their generous funding, which has been vital in supporting and facilitating the completion of this research project. The dedicated time, effort, and genuine interest invested by Josef Teichmann and Panos Parpas as they examined this thesis are greatly appreciated as well. % Both provided contributions and insightful feedback that have greatly enriched the quality and scholarly value of this work.

I am grateful to Aitor for his guidance at the beginning of my PhD, Alex and Urban for thoughtful discussions during my PhD. Julian for sparking captivating discussions about the electrifying culture of the UK and Imperial. Felix and Luca, with whom we slowly realised that taking mathematics too seriously is simply not a prerequisite for intellectual triumph.
